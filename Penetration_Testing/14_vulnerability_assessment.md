# Vulnerability assessment

## What is a Vulnerability Assessment?

> A vulnerability assessment is a process that identifies the bugs that could be exploited on your network, along with how important the associate threat really is. 

Silent Breach conducts a thorough analysis to determine the attack surface that is intentionally or unintentionally exposed and correlates it with a risk value to determine your security posture.

Vulnerability Assessment Tools:
  - OpenVAS
  - Nessus
  - Nexpose
  - Outpost24
  - Qualys

### Nessus?
> Nessus is a remote security scanning tool that gives you a variety of options for arranging results, which scans a computer and raises an alert if it discovers any vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could use to gain access to any computer you have connected to a network. 

It does this by running over 1200 checks on a given computer, testing to see if any of these attacks could be used to break into the computer or otherwise harm it.


**How Nessus Works?**

Most high-level network traffic, such as email, web pages, etc. reach a server via a high-level protocol that is transmitted reliably by a TCP stream. 

To keep different streams from interfering with each other, a computer divides its physical connection to the network into thousands of ports. 

Each computer has thousands of ports, all of which may or may not have services (i.e.: a server for a specific high-level protocol) listening on them. 

Nessus works by **testing** each port on a computer, **determining** what service it is running, and then testing this service to make sure there are no vulnerabilities in it that could be used by a hacker to carry out a malicious attack. 

Nessus is called a "remote scanner" because it does not need to be installed on a computer for it to test that computer.  Instead, you can install it on only one computer and test as many computers as you would like.
