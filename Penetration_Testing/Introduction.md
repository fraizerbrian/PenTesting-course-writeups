# Introduction to Penetration Testing

PenTesting is the practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

## Penetration Testing steps
1. Information Gathering
  1. Passive
  2. Active
2. Vulnerability Identification
  1. Nmap
  2. Nessus
  3. OpenVas
3. Exploitation
  1. Brute Forcing
  2. Remote Exploit
4. Post Exploitation
  1. Persistence
  2. Anti Forensics
  
## Penetration testing methodologies
This is a comprehensive methodical approach used in penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the overall security posture of an organization.
Pentesting methodologies need to be extremely comprehensive and accurate to ensure that a penetration test is performed successfully
1. Planning
  - Working with a customer to clearly define and document assessment objectives, scope and rules of engagement.
2. Gathering Information
  - Collecting and examining key information about an application and its infrastructure.
3. Discovering vulnerabilities
  - Finding existing vulnerabilities, using both manual and automated techniques.
4. Reporting
  - Providing a comprehensive report with deep analysis and recommendations on how to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities.
  
## Vulnerabke system
A vulnerable system suffers from misconfigured program.

It may be Code Structure Issue or Language Issue.

eg
  1. SQL Injection > Code structure issue.
  2. Open ports > misconfigured services.
  
## Penetration Testing Areas
1. Network/Infrastructure penetration testing
  * Unpatched OS
  * Misconfiguration of server or network device
2. Web apps penetration testing
  * Server-side vulnerabilities
  * Client-side vulnerabilities
3. Wireless Network penetration testing
  * Open/Rogue AP
  * Insecure encryption
4. Social Engineering penetration testing
  * Dropping USB
  * Unauthorized access
  * Phishing Email with a malicious link
