[ ] RSA, and some of the uses of RSA
[ ] 2 methods of Key Exchange
[ ] Notes about the future of encryption with the rise of Quantum Computing

## Terms
1. Ciphertext - the result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data.
2. Cipher - A method of encrypting or decrypting data.
3. Plaintext - Data before encrpytion, often text but not always text.
4. Encryption - Transforming data into ciphertext using a cipher.
5. Encoding - A form of data representation eg base64.
6. Key - Some information needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.
7. Passphrase - Similar to a password and used to protect a key.
8. Assymmetric encryption - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.
9. Symmetric encryption - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt.
10. Brute force - Attacking cryptography by trying different password or every different key.
11. Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths.
 
SSH Keys are protected with a `passphrase`

## Importance of Cryptography
It is used to protect confidentiality, ensure integrity and ensure authenticity.

Sensitive user data needs to be stored in an encrypted format.

Do not encrypt passwords unless doing something like a password manager.

Passwords should not as well be stored in plaintext, `hashing` can be done to manage them safely.
